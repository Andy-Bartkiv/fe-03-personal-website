        "description" : "<p>This was my very-first project in vanilla JavaScript, utilizing learning-by-doing approach in my web development self-taught journey. The objective was to recreate Sid Meier's vintage mini-game by reverse engineering, sticking to original design and using Canvas API for game animation. Browser localStorage is used to keep player high-scores.</p>"
